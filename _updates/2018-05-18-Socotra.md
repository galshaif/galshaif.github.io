Hundreds of Yemenis marched through Socotra's capital to protest against UAE forces taking control of Socotra island. Four Emirati military aircrafts carrying armored vehicles and more than 50 soldiers have already arrived on the island. Once deployed, the UAE force seized control of the Socotra airport and port.--- [Middle East Monitor](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180508-yemen-hundreds-protest-against-uae-control-of-socotra-island/)
